This repo contains .R and .py files for the project Iowa Liquor Sales.

Overview
The Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division is the alcoholic beverage control authority for the U.S. state of Iowa. This division regulates the alcohol traffic and has a monopoly on the wholesaling of alcoholic beverages in the state.
Our models are about making suggestions to The Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division regarding reducing inventory costs and give insights into sale patterns of Alcohol at each county in Iowa. We intend to deliver the following objectives:
1. 	Predict monthly liquor sales
2. 	Identify the top liquor brands sold and assess their popularity
3. 	Make suggestions for locations of delivery pads to reduce inventory costs.
4. 	Investigate sale trends based on public events and holidays in IOWA
5. 	Find the most common brands of liquor sold together at each county
 
Model No.1: Time series Model
We aim at making a good Time Series model in order to  forecast category wise Liquor sales. This will help the Iowa state administration to figure out what kind of liquor has more chances to be sold in the coming time. For this purpose we need to estimate and eliminate the trend and seasonal components in the time series data. Find if our series is stationary or non-stationary, and then make a choice of appropriate model.

Model No.2: Decision Tree
We aim to make Decision tree to classify and predict if any new product launches in the market does it have potential to be sold in  counties that generate more business for IOWA liquor sales distributors.

Model No.3: Clustering
We want to make suggestions to the Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division to build some delivery pads near the areas with high concentration of liquor shops. We will use latitude and longitude of store locations to group all the stores in short distance from each other into a single cluster and identify these localities in each county to suggest nearby locations for delivery pads.

Model No.4: Linear Regression
Use demographic data to check the relation between per capita income and liquor volume sold in a county and we will choose the top county in terms of liquor sales and find what are the top brands sold in that county using regression.
